# WordPress Code Assistant | Learn LangChain

This is a demo project related to the [Learn LangChain](https://learnlangchain.org/) mini-course.

In this project we will use some core LangChain components (Chains, PromptTemplates),
to achieve a powerful outcome: a WordPress code assistant capable to handle real development
tasks. It's inspired by an AI-assisted code technique I use in my own development projects.

Working demo on: https://wordpress-code-assistant.streamlit.app/
