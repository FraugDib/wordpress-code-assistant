This is a demo project related to the [Learn LangChain](https://learnlangchain.org/) mini-course.
In this project we will use some core LangChain components (Chains, PromptTemplates), to achieve
a powerful outcome: a WordPress code assistant capable to handle real development tasks.
It's inspired by an AI-assisted code technique I use in my own development projects.

    The main task can be broken in the following sub-tasks:
    - When a new user activates his account in BuddyBoss, add a custom user metadata containing
    the key "to_welcome".
    - Write a function to send a private BuddyBoss message to a specific user by ID,the message content
    should be customizable as a variable. Name the function "wca_send_private_message".
    - Create a WordPress user query that retrieves all the user Ids with the "to_welcome" usermeta,
    runs a send_private_message($user_id) function to each user and deletes the "to_welcome" metadata.
    Wrap it in a function called bulk_welcome_users().
    - add a daily cron event which invokes bulk_welcome_users() using WP cron.

    Try to pass each command to the LLM as Custom prompt below, and the code provided should
    be suitable to implement a system that sends a daily welcome message in BuddyPress to
    newly registered users.

    This demo is probably the most interesting one to expand and improve:
    - Browse [the code on GitHub](https://github.com/francescocarlucci/wordpress-code-assistant/blob/main/app.py) and make sure you understand it.
    - Fork the repository to customize the code.
    - If you are creating code or WordPress plugin giving multiple prompts, adding memory to the LLM can be a huge improvement. Try it!
    - Brave improvement: add another step to the chain and try to use a LLM to handle the initial task breakdown.

While is true that most of the times the check will pass if we have a well writen and specific prompt
task, this feature is very helpful to handle LLM hallucinations and bad code in response to poorly
written prompts. Plus, you can try to plug in a different LLM to test the code making the whole system
more reliable.
